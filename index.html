        <br><br>
        Some of my achievements so far include:-
        <br><br>
        <ul class="ulist">
          <li>Building my first portfolio website (this one!).
          </li>
          <li>Learning the fundamentals of C programming, HTML,CSS and problem-solving.</li>
          <li>Creating educational and engaging Instagram/Youtube content around business and world issues.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        I strongly believe in continuous growth, and I see every project, no matter how small, as a step toward
        mastering my craft.
